## 📖 About The Project

This project is a Python-based calculator designed to perform arithmetic operations with error handling. It demonstrates core programming concepts such as function definition, user input handling, control flow, and exception handling.

It is capable of:
* Performing Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
* Handling floating-point numbers.
* Preventing crashes when dividing by zero.


## 🚀 Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Clear prompts and results (CLI or GUI).
- **Continuous Operation:** Perform multiple calculations without restarting.
- **Safe Math:** Includes `try-except` blocks to handle invalid inputs (like letters) and mathematical errors.
- **Clean Code:** Follows PEP 8 styling guidelines.

## 🛠️ Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - The core programming language.
* [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) - (Optional) Used if you built a GUI version.

## 🏁 Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.6 or higher installed.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repo**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/python-calculator.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/python-calculator.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the directory**
    ```sh
    cd python-calculator
    ```
3.  **Run the application**
    ```sh
    python calculator.py
    ```

## 💻 Usage Examples

Here is how the Command Line Interface (CLI) functions:

```text
Select operation:
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide

Enter choice (1/2/3/4): 1
Enter first number: 15
Enter second number: 5

Result: 15.0 + 5.0 = 20.0
