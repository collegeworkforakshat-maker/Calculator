# PROJECT STATEMENT

## Problem Statement
In today's digital age, users often need quick access to basic mathematical calculations while working on their computers. Many existing calculator applications are either too complex with unnecessary features or lack a user-friendly graphical interface. There is a need for a simple, lightweight, and intuitive desktop calculator application that provides essential arithmetic operations without the overhead of advanced scientific functions that most users don't require for daily tasks.

## Scope of the Project
This project involves developing a desktop-based calculator application using Python's Tkinter framework. The calculator will focus on providing core arithmetic operations through a clean and responsive graphical user interface. The application will be standalone, requiring no internet connection, and will run on any system with Python installed. The scope is limited to basic mathematical operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, with support for decimal numbers.

## Target Users
- **Students**: For quick calculations during homework and study sessions
- **Office Workers**: For basic arithmetic needs during daily work tasks
- **Home Users**: For everyday calculations such as budgeting and simple math problems
- **Beginners in Programming**: As a reference for understanding GUI application development
- **Anyone seeking a distraction-free, simple calculator**: Users who prefer minimalist tools without complex scientific functions

## High-level Features
- **Intuitive Graphical User Interface**: Clean and modern design with clearly labeled buttons and a large display area
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Support for addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/)
- **Decimal Number Support**: Ability to work with decimal points for precise calculations
- **Real-time Display Updates**: Immediate visual feedback as users input numbers and operations
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of invalid operations and division by zero errors
- **Clear Function**: Quick reset of all calculations with a single button press
- **Backspace/Delete Function**: Ability to correct input mistakes by removing the last entered character
- **Responsive Button Layout**: Grid-based design that scales appropriately within the application window
- **Keyboard-free Operation**: Full functionality through mouse/touchpad clicks on the GUI buttons
- **Lightweight and Fast**: Minimal resource consumption with instant response to user interactions
